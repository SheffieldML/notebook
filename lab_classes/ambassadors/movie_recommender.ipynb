      "# Learning from Data: Movie Recommendation in the IPython Notebook\n",
      "### A Lab Class for the University of Sheffield Department of Computer Science Ambassadors' Scheme\n",
      "\n",
      "### [Neil D. Lawrence](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Lawrence/) and the [Sheffield Machine Learning Research Group](http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/)\n",
      "#### 8th October 2014\n",
      "\n",
      "This session is about 'learning from data'. How do we take the information on the internet and make sense of it. The answer, as you might expect, is using computers and mathematics. Luckily we also have a suite of tools to help. The first tool is a way of programming in python that really facilitates *interaction* with data. It is known as the \"[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\", or more recently as the \"[Jupyter Project](http://jupyter.org/)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "### Welcome to the IPython Notebook\n",
      "\n",
      "The notebook is a great way of interacting with computers. In particular it allows me to integrate text descriptions, maths and code all together in the same place. For me, that's what my research is all about. I try to take concepts that people can describe, then I try to capture the essence of the concept in a *mathematical* model. Then I try and implement the model on a computer, often combining it with data, to try and do something fun. Today's fun thing is going to be *recommender systems*.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommender Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you watch Netflix? Have you ever rated a movie there? Do you buy books or electronics on Amazon? How about grocery shopping? All these companies want you to buy more, watch more or listen more. The best way of getting you to do that is by showing you more of what you like. But what do you like? What sort of person are you? Can the computer tell? It can certainly try! And it does so with a \"Recommender System\". Recommender systems are so important to Netflix that they offered a [$1 million dollar prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) for improving theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is a Recommender System?\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand you the computer has to turn you into a series of numbers (but don't worry, it's not painful), to perform computations we need numbers. How many numbers does it need to describe you? How many numbers does it take to summarize anyone's tastes in movies, music or groceries? These are open questions that can be difficult to answer. It depends how much we want to know about you: if it's just your taste in film and clothes that's one thing. If we want to summarize your state of health, that's another. Apparently a three year old's brain has $10^{15}$ synapses in it: a synapse governs the connection between neurons. It's quite possible that each synapse needs a number to represent it. So in the end it takes a lot of numbers to represent just the brain of a human, and that's before we start talking about what's going on in each of your cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won't try and represent all this, instead we will perform a 'compression' on you. We will try and represent your opinions about films into just a couple of numbers. We are going to work with movies, and just for fun, we thought we'd get you to rate some movies and try and build a recommendation system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Preparation\n",
      "\n",
      "First things first. You need to have a gmail account you can use (we're going to use this to find out what movies you like). And I need to know what your gmail account is, so that I can share some movie information with you for you to rate.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once we have your details, the next thing we need to do is download some data! The next bit of software downloads some of our code from a *version control system* called `github`. Github is a place for keeping software, that allows us to update the software and keep track of changes. Every time I make a change to the software, I update it on github and share it with my friends and colleagues. \n",

To do this you need to click on the box and press either `CTRL-Enter` or `SHIFT-Enter` (see if you can tell what the difference is between these two commands). The code below downloads the software in a [zip file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)), unzips it, and then adds the software to the python's [path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) where the software can be easily loaded in with an `import` command."

      "Note that python, like many other programs has a lot of software libraries for doing different things. Here we used three separate libraries (which we also loaded into the computer with the `import` commands) to perform three different jobs.

That's because when running code in the notebook, the python kernel (which is the software in the computer that's running the python code) has a *state*. By state we mean the values of the different variables in the system. The values of these variables can have a lot of effects, like which program code is in memory, and therefore accessibile to the computer. By running commands in this notebook, we change that state of the computer all the time. The software below relies on the software above being run to work. The notebook lets you know which box was run when by placing a number beside the box. After the code's been run you should see a number like:\n",

      "Whilst the notebook is waiting for the kernel to run commands, you will see `In [*]:` as the prompt. If this happens for too long, it may be that you've asked the computer to do something too complicated and it's getting slow. You can *interrupt* the kernel by selecting `Kernel->Interrupt` from the menu in the browser window above. If you get really confused about what's going on and want to wipe the state of the kernel clean, then you can select `Kernel->Restart`. That will reset the kernel's state."

      "### Download the Movie Body Counts Data\n",
      "\n",
      "We are going to download some data on 'movie body counts'. I like this data, not because of all the bodies, but because there is so much you can do with it. However, I wasn't the first to get this data set together. That was done by some [researchers at NJIT](http://www.theswarmlab.com/r-vs-python-round-2-22/) who combined data from the [IMDb website](http://www.imdb.com) and [www.MovieBodyCounts.com](http://www.MovieBodyCounts.com). Let's pause a minute and reflect on that. The data set was created by someone else, who themselves built on the work of many others. If I could summarize the internet in one idea, that might be it. The internet is just a really great way of sharing stuff really quickly. And if someone does something cool (like IMDb) then it's easy for someone else to build something on top of it. And it all works best when we are happy to share things. So openness is good! However, openness is not always good and we'll discuss some of the downsides later on. I'm getting you all to share information with me about what movies you like. That's personal information, it's probably not the most *sensitive* personal information, but it's personal all the same. That means I have to be careful how I handle it. When you share things on the internet, you are giving something away, although very often you will get something back (like a cool social network, or a neat recommender system). But you always have to think about how good a deal you are getting. Anyway, for the moment let's just enjoy all that sharing that others have done and download the 'Movie Body Count' data set. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you press `SHIFT-enter` or `CTRL-enter` for the next part you will get told that you are about to download data from a github repository. This is just done to give credit to the people who kindly shared their data with us (giving credit to people makes them happy to continue sharing, so this is a very important thing to do). You can have a quick read of what it says, and then just type `yes` and press `enter`. It will only do this the first time you download the data to this computer, after that it is saved on your disk."

The data frame allows us to refer easily to the different parts of the data by writing:\n",

You might not (yet) think that it is easy to understand what's going on in the code boxes, but with a bit of playing around I think you'll get there! One reason I like python is that the syntax is flexible and often readable, especially when compared to languages that came before it like [`perl`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), although you can write some nice poetry in `perl`, check out [this example](http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=1092395), isn't it romantic? Enough of romance! Let's return to movie body counts. \n",

It's interesting that when doing data science it often takes more lines of code to do the visualization (plotting and other stuff) and the loading in of the data than to do the actual analysis! However, a lot of thought has to go into the lines which do the analysis, which just shows that it's quality not quantity that counts."

      "## Recommendation in Numbers\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we got distracted counting bodies, I said that we need to reduce everything to numbers for recommendations on the computer. Let's think about what those numbers could be. A recommender system aims to make suggestions for *items* (films, books, music, groceries) given what it knows about *users'* tastes. The recommendation engine needs to represent the *taste* of all the users and the *characteristics* of each object. That is what our numbers should do.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way for organizing objects is to place related things close together. You can spend a lot of time doing this when you are supposed to be revising. It's called tidying up. Tidying up can be quite important, for example in a library we try and put books that are on related topics near to each other on the shelves. One system for doing this is known as [Dewey Decimal Classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification). In the Dewey Decimal Classification system (which dates from 1876) each subject is given a number (in fact it's a decimal number---no surprises there!). For example the fields of *Sciences* and *Mathematics* are all given numbers starting in the 500s. Because computers weren't around in 1876 (well a man called Charles Babbage was toying with the idea ... and a lady called Ada Lovelace was even thinking about programming languages) ... anyway as I was saying, because computers weren't around in 1876 they didn't get a number so they ended up being given numbers staring with 004 ... so for example works on the 'mathematical principles' of Computer science are given the series 004.0151 (which we might normally write as 4.0151, but when you think about it we could equally write 004.0151). Whilst it's a *classification* system for splitting books into groups (this is sometimes called a *taxonomy*) the books in the system are also normally laid out in the same order as the numbers. Ah ... back to the point numbers. \n",
      "\n",
      "So in the Dewey Decimal system we might now expect that neighbouring numbers represent books that are *related* to each other in subject. That seems to be exactly what we want for our recommender system! Could we somehow represent each film's subject according to a number? \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem here is that we are representing it with only *one* number, a so called *one* dimensional representation of the system. Actually a *one* dimensional representation of a subject can be very awkward. To see this, let's have another think about the Dewey Decimal system. However, this time we can think about subjects which have numbers in the 900s. By the way, I'm not an expert on the Dewey Decimal system, I just read the wikipedia page on it and then found a list of the numbers from  [Nova Southeastern University](http://www.nova.edu/library/help/misc/lc_dewey/dewey900.html#40) ... I may be a bit geeky, but memorizing the Dewey Decimal numbers is a step too far for even me (and don't memorize $\\pi$ either, [memorize $\\tau$ instead](http://www.tauday.com/) ...).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anway, back to those Dewey decimals ... if we look at the list for the 900s from the link above, we see that whilst the ordering for places is somewhat sensible, it is also rather arbitrary. In the 940s we have Europe listed from 940-949, Asia listed from 950-959 and Africa listed from 960-969. That seems OK, because Asia borders Europe, and Africa borders Asia (sorry I've slipped into a Geography lesson here ...). But it's also true that Africa is very close to Europe and the [Carthagian's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage) had an empire that went across both ... add did the Romans (a bit of History thrown in too). \n",

      "</center>\n",
      "\n",
      "Where should those books go? If they went between Africa and Europe they'd end up in Asia ... which would be wrong. Ah! But that's easy to solve, let's just represent the subject by *two* numbers and then we can lay out the books like a map!\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspired by the map example we can start considering how we might lay out *films* in two dimensions. Although we also would like to characterize people too ... maybe we could also make a map of people's interests. In fact maybe the map could be a map of the same space. Let's think of it as a film library ... then the people could sit *near* the *films* they were interested in. We would have two maps of the same place. One of where the films are, and one of where the people are. People could sit near the films they like, and then they wouldn't have to move far to get the next film they'd want to watch (don't take the analogy too far though, if you start thinking about toilets and snack bars it kind of breaks down ... but fortunately we've turned you into a number now so you don't need the toilet or a snack bar). \n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! We've cracked it ... or at least we've come up with *one* way of doing it. Although now, the fun just starts. Once you've had the idea, now you get to do the maths."

Not around town and to Meadowhall of course (even numbers don't like going to Meadowhall), but mathematically. I can represent lots of things by vectors, anything I can represent by numbers in fact. So since people can be numbers then I can represent *people* by vectors. This is not such a strange thing, and in fact it is being done to you all the time. If you use Facebook, they represent you by a vector (or actually more than one vector ... but all vectors can be returned to one vector at the end of the day ... have a think about why that is so). The vector that facebook have determines which items will come to the top of your news feed. It determines what adverts you see. It *even* determines who your friends are ... well actually that's taking it a bit far ... it just determines who Facebook *suggests* to you for friends. \n",

If it's a good experience, then you'll go there and interact more ... if it's a dull experience you'll wonder off to WhatsApp or Instagram ... or maybe even Google+.  If they get that vector right, then they've captured something about your personality and they can create a better Facebook tailored for you.\n",

When people are piloting planes, they are often told they are being 'vectored'. It doesn't mean Facebook are turning them into a series of numbers (although Facebook probably are, that's just not what they mean on this occasion).

The cosine is applied to the angle between the vectors (or people).

The objective function defines which bits of the landscape are good (ironically these are the *low* points) and the points in the landscape which are bad (these are the *high* points). This process is known as optimization (don't confuse it with optimism, where high points and low points provide different roles). \n",

OK, but you get the idea. It turns out that we can use the technique of *differentiation* to compute the gradient of the objective function. The gradient is also a *vector*. And the gradient *descent* algorithm involves simply taking your current vector and subtracting off the gradient. It's rather like what a ball would do if it was pushed off Kinder Scout (well, actually, the ball would probably be blown upwards knowing the winds up there).

Books on the American invasion of Sicily in 1943 are perhaps less related to books about Carthage than those books that study the Jewish Revolt from 66-70 (in the Roman Province of Judaea---more History!). So books that relate to subjects which are closer in time should probably be stored together. However, a student of 'rebellion against empire' may also be interested in the relationship between the Jewish Revolt of 66-70 and the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (against the British Empire), nearly 1800 years later (they might also like the Star Wars movies ...). Whilst the technologies involved in these revolts would be different, they still involve people (who we argued could all be summarised by sets of numbers) and the *psychology* of those people is shared: a rebellious nation angainst their imperial masters, triggered by misrule with a religious and cultural background. \n",

Can we really understand the facets of a film that only has at most three or four ratings? One answer is to collect more data to justify extra dimensions. If you have got this far, maybe you'd like to 'fight on' against the imperial misrule of data, and consider the movielens 100k data below: many more ratings from many more users!"
