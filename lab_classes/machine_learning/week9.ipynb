      "# Probabilistic Classification\n",
      "\n",
      "### 25th November 2014 Neil D. Lawrence\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning problems normally involve a prediction function and an objective function. So far in the course we've mainly focussed on the case where the prediction function was over the real numbers, so the codomain of the functions, $f(\\mathbf{X})$ was the real numbers or sometimes real vectors. The classification problem consists of predicting whether or not a particular example is a member of a particular class. So we may want to know if a particular image represents a digit 6 or if a particular user will click on a given advert. These are classification problems, and they require us to map to *yes* or *no* answers. That makes them naturally discrete mappings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In classification we are given an input vector, $\\mathbf{x}$, and an associated label, $y$ which either takes the value $0$ or $1$. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our focus has been on models where the objective function is inspired by a probabilistic analysis of the problem. In particular we've argued that we answer questions about the data set by placing probability distributions over the various quantities of interest. For the case of binary classification this will normally involve introducing probability distributions for discrete variables. Such probability distributions, are in some senses easier than those for continuous variables, in particular we can represent a probability distribution over $y$, where $y$ is binary, with one value. If we specify the probability that $y=1$ with a number that is between 0 and 1, i.e. let's say that $P(y=1) = \\pi$ (here we don't mean $\\pi$ the number, we are setting $\\pi$ to be a variable) then we can specify the probability distribution through a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "| y      | 0         | 1     |\n",
      "|:------:|:---------:|:-----:|\n",
      "| $P(y)$ | $(1-\\pi)$ | $\\pi$ |\n",
      "\n",
      "Mathematically we can use a trick to implement this same table. We can use the value $y$ as a mathematical switch and write that\n",
      "$$\n",
      "P(y) = \\pi^y (1-pi)^(1-y)\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where our probability distribution is now written as a function of $y$. This probability distribution is known as the [Bernoulli distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution). The Bernoulli distribution is a clever trick for mathematically switching between two probabilities if we were to write it as code it would be better described as\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def bernoulli(x, pi):\n",
      "    if y_i == 1:\n",
      "        return pi(x)\n",
      "    else:\n",
      "        return 1-pi(x)\n",
      "```\n",
      "If we insert $y=1$ then the function is equal to $\\pi$, and if we insert $y=0$ then the function is equal to $1-\\pi$. So the function recreates the table for the distribution given above.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The probability distribution is named for [Jacob Bernoulli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli), the swiss mathematician. In his book Ars Conjectandi he considered the distribution and the result of a number of 'trials' under the Bernoulli distribution to form the *binomial* distribution. Below is the page where he considers Pascal's triangle in forming combinations of the Bernoulli distribution to realise the binomial distribution for the outcome of positive trials."

We will consider how to form a classification by making assumptions about the *joint* density of our observations. We need to make assumptions to reduce the number of parameters we need to optimise. In the ideal world, given label data $\\mathbf{y}$ and the inputs $\\mathbf{X}$ we should be able to specify the joint density of all potential values of $\\mathbf{y}$ and $\\mathbf{X}$, $p(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})$. If $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ are our training data, and we can somehow extend our density to incorporate future test data (by augmenting $\\mathbf{y}$ with a new observation $y^*$ and $\\mathbf{X}$ with the corresponding inputs, $\\mathbf{x}^*$, then we can answer any given question about a future test point $y^*$ given its covariates $\\mathbf{x}^*$ by conditioning on the training variables to recover,\n",

There are $2^n$ possible combinations for the vector $\\mathbf{y}$ and the probability for each of these combinations must be jointly specified along with the joint density of the matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, as well as being able to *extend* the density for any chosen test location $\\mathbf{x}^*$. \n",

We made similar assumptions for regression, where our parameter set included $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\sigma^2$.

This definitely can happen in practice. If some of the features are rare or very common across the data set then the maximum likelihood solution could find values of zero or one respectively. Such values are problematic because they cause posterior probabilities of class membership of either one or zero. In practice we deal with this using *Laplace smoothing* (which actually has an interpretation as a Bayesian fit of the Bernoulli distribution.

So we can think of Laplace's idea saying (before we start) that we have 'two observations worth of belief, that the odds are 50/50', because before we start (i.e. when $n=0$) our estimate is 0.5, yet because the effective $n$ is only 2, this estimate is quickly overwhelmed by data. Laplace used ideas like this a lot, and it is known as his 'principle of insufficient reason'. His idea was that in the absence of knowledge (i.e. before we start) we should assume that all possible outcomes are equally likely. This idea has a modern counterpart, known as the [principle of maximum entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy). A lot of the theory of this approach was developed by [Ed Jaynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes), who according to his erstwhile collaborator and friend, John Skilling, learnt French as an undergraduate by reading the works of Laplace. Although John also related that Jaynes's spoken French was not up to the standard of his scientific French. For me Ed Jaynes's work very much carries on the tradition of Laplace into the modern era, in particular his focus on Bayesian approaches. I'm very proud to have met those that knew and worked with him. It turns out that Laplace's idea also has a Bayesian interpretation (as Laplace understood), it comes from assuming a particular prior density for the parameter $\\pi$, but we won't explore that interpretation for the moment, and merely choose to estimate the probability as,\n",

      "Naive Bayes is making very simple assumptions about the data, in particular it is modeling the full *joint* probability of the data set, $p(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X} | \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\pi)$ by very strong assumptions about factorizations that are unlikely to be true in practice. The data conditional independence assumption is common, and relies on a rich parameter vector to absorb all the information in the training data. The additional assumption of naive Bayes is that features are conditional indpenendent given the class label $y_i$ (and the parameter vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. This is quite a strong assumption. However, it causes the objective function to decompose into parts which can be independently fitted to the different feature vectors, meaning it is very easy to fit the model to large data. It is also clear how we should handle *streaming* data and *missing* data. This means that the model can be run 'live', adapting parameters and information as it arrives. Indeed, the model is even capable of dealing with new *features* that might arrive at run time. Such is the strength of the modeling the joint probability density. However, the factorization assumption that allows us to do this efficiently is very strong and may lead to poor decision boundaries in practice."
