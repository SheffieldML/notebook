      "We've now seen how we may perform linear regression. Now, we are going to consider how we can perform *non-linear* regression. However, before we get into the details of how to do that we first need to consider in what ways the regression can be non-linear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Multivariate linear regression allows us to build models that take many features into account when making our prediction. In this session we are going to introduce *basis functions*. The term seems complicted, but they are actually based on rather a simple idea. If we are doing a multivariate linear regression, we get extra features that *might* help us predict our required response varible (or target value), $y$. But what if we only have one input value? We can actually artificially generate more input values with basis functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-linear in the Inputs\n",
      "\n",
      "When we refer to non-linear regression, we are normally referring to whether the regression is non-linear in the input space, or non-linear in the *covariates*. The covariates are the observations that move with the target (or *response*) variable. In our notation we have been using $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to represent a vector of the covariates associated with the $i$th observation. The coresponding response variable is $y_i$. If a model is non-linear in the inputs, it means that there is a non-linear function between the inputs and the response variable. Linear functions are functions that only involve multiplication and addition, in other words they can be represented through *linear algebra*. Linear regression involves assuming that a function takes the form\n",
      "$$\n",
      "f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $\\mathbf{w}$ are our regression weights. A very easy way to make the linear regression non-linear is to introduce non-linear functions. When we are introducing non-linear regression these functions are known as *basis functions*.\n",

      "### Basis Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the idea, instead of working directly on the original input space, $\\mathbf{x}$, we build models in a new space, $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x})$ where $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\cdot)$ is a *vector valued* function that is defined on the space $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, that a vector valued function is just a vector that contains functions instead of values. Here's an example for a one dimensional input space, $x$, being projected to a *quadratic* basis. First we consider each basis function in turn, we can think of the elements of our vector as being indexed so that we have\n",
