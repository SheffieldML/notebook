In the session on [Bayesian regression](./week7.ipynb) we sampled directly from the weight vector, $\\mathbf{w}$ and applied it to the basis matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ to obtain a sample from the prior and a sample from the posterior. It is often helpful to think of modeling techniques as *generative* models. To give some thought as to what the process for obtaining data from the model is. From the perspective of Gaussian processes, we want to start by thinking of basis function models, where the parameters are sampled from a prior, but move to thinking about sampling from the marginal likelihood directly.\n",

In this case the gradient of the covariance matrix with respect to $\\alpha$ is simply $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1}\\mathbf{C} = \\alpha^{-1}$. This means we can write,\n",

      "The log determinant term has an interpretation as a log volume. The determinant of the covariance is related to Gaussian density's 'footprint'. Recall that the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues represent a set of axes which describe the correlations of the Gaussian densities (the directions being given by the corresponding eigenvectors). The product of these eigenvalues gives the area (or volume) of the Gaussian density. Roughly speaking it represents the diversity of different functions the Gaussian process can represent. If the number is large, then the process can represent many functions. If it is small then the process can represent fewer functions. Although the terms 'many' and 'few' are badly defined here because the space is continuous and the Gaussian process represents a continuum of different functions. However, the intuition is maybe useful. \n",
      "\n",
      "The data fit term is a little like a quadratic well, trying to locate the data at the lowest point. The data fit term can be driven to zero by increasing the scale of the covariance. However, this causes the capacity term to also increase, so a penalty is paid for this. Ideally, the data fit term should be reduced by matching correlations seen in the data with a corresponding correlation in the covariance function."
