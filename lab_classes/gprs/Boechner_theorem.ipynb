      "Imagine we are given data and we wish to generalize from it. Without making further assumptions, we have no more information than the given data set. We can think of this ssomewhat like a weighted sum of Dirac delta functions. The Dirac delta function is defined to be a function with an integral of one, which is zero at all places apart from zero, where it is infinite. Given observations at particular times (or locations) $x_i$ we can think of our observations as being a function,\n",

      "One theorem that gives insight into covariances is Boechner's theorem. Boechner's theorem states that any positive filter in Fourier space gives rise to a valid covariance function. Further, it gives a relationship between the filter and the form of the covariance function. The form of the covariance is given by the [Fourier transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) of the filter, with the argument of the transform being replaced by the distance between the points. \n",
